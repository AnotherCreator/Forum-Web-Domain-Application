## Description
"Jaxper" is a personal project which aims to recreate and implement the essence of various popular forum platforms such
as "Reddit" and "Lemmy." This project is based on a previous semester long assignment that I did which recreated a 
[Library Domain Application](https://github.com/AnotherCreator/Library-Domain-Application). With this, I aim to fully
extend into recreating a fully functioning forum web app hosted locally for now as a proof-of-concept.

## What I Aim to Learn and Further Enhance in this Project
### Backend Development Proficiency
I aim to enhance my proficiency in backend development by utilizing Java as the primary language. 
This project provides me with an opportunity to deepen my understanding of building robust and scalable applications 
while implementing best practices in backend architecture.  

### Database Management with MySQL
By working with mySQL to store and manage various domain entities, 
I aim to strengthen my skills in designing efficient and reliable database structures.  

### Comprehensive Testing Strategies with JUnit 
The comprehensive suite of JUnit tests incorporated into this project allows me to learn and implement 
effective testing strategies. I aim to ensure code reliability and stability by practicing thorough testing 
methodologies, which are crucial aspects of software development.  

### Security Implementation and User Authorization
Jaxper's focus on security groups to manage user authority levels presents a valuable learning opportunity. 
By implementing and managing security features within the forum, 
I aim to gain insights into creating secure environments and handling user authorization effectively.  

### Detailed Documentation Writing
In addition to technical skills, this project offers me an opportunity to enhance my ability to write detailed and 
comprehensive documentation. I aim to create clear and concise documentation that explains the project architecture, 
functionalities, and usage instructions. This skill is essential for effective communication with team members, 
stakeholders, and users, facilitating better understanding and utilization of the software.
